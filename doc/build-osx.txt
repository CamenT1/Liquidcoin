Mac OS X litecoind build instructions

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Litecoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5 and 10.6 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone git@github.com:coblee/litecoin.git litecoin

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl

Install the right version of miniupnpc:
pushd litecoin/contrib/minipupnpc; sudo port install; popd
(this will be unnecessary soon, you will just port install miniupnpc
along with the rest of the dependencies).

4.  Now you should be able to build litecoind:

cd litecoin/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./litecoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./litecoind -daemon # to start the litecoin daemon.
Run
  ./litecoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
